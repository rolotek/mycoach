## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 6 requirement categories -- AUTH+LLM grouped as Foundation, COACH+MEM grouped as Coaching & Memory, AGENT as Agent System, EVOL as Agent Evolution
- [Roadmap]: Research recommended Phase 5 (Community & Deployment) but those map to v2 requirements, not v1
- [01-01]: Use existing local Postgres via DATABASE_URL; no Docker Compose

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged version verification gap: all package versions from training data (May 2025 cutoff). Verify current versions during Phase 1 planning.
